# COWOMO demo 2018

In this repository, it is possible to find two SDSoC projects:

 * `2core_4hw_4slices`
 * `async_2core_4hw_4slices`
 
 The two project were tested using `SDSoC 2017.1`.
 
 The tutorial used to re-create the same source file for SDSoC using [PREESM](https://preesm.github.io/) can be found at [this link](https://preesm.github.io/tutos/sdsoc/).
 
 Moreover, the presentation slides can be found [within the CERBERO-H2020 EU project website](https://www.cerbero-h2020.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/COWOMO2018_LSuriano.pdf) and, also, in this repository.
 
 The demo was created with a joint effort of Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid and INSA - Rennes.
